# Rosters of fire department forms

This repository is a holding area for lists of fire department forms (known as "forms rosters") in the United States and abroad.

A forms roster is a document that tracks the forms maintained by a fire department, or other government organization. It can be extremely useful for both journalists and citizen activists, as it allows the public to see what information a law-enforcement organization tracks. This, in turn, can facilitate more efficient information requests.

For police department rosters of forms, please see https://github.com/patrickmaynard/rosters-of-forms, which contains (as of this writing) police form lists from 31 states.  

Happy requesting!
